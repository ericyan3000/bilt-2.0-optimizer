Bilt 2.0 Global Strategy Lab

An interactive, standalone optimization tool designed for the 2026 Bilt Rewards ecosystem. This dashboard helps users maximize their points by balancing everyday spending against high-volume mortgage payments, accounting for the new tiered ratio rules and the "Bilt Cash" conversion pathway.

🚀 Key Features

Multi-Mortgage Routing: Manage up to four distinct mortgage payments. Toggle them individually to see how principal volume affects your reward tiers.

Dynamic Tier Calculation: Real-time calculation of Tier 1 (0.5x) through Tier 4 (1.25x) based on your spend-to-mortgage ratio.

Pathway Toggle: Switch between Tiered Spending (Option B) and Bilt Cash Conversion (Option A) to find the math-winner for your specific month.

Marginal Yield Analysis: A dedicated chart comparing the value of every dollar spent on Bilt against a 5% Cashback Rival Card. Know exactly when to stop spending on Bilt and switch cards.

Auto-Optimize Engine: A one-click recommendation tool that tests all 16 possible mortgage combinations to find the highest point yield for your current settled spend.

Custom Valuation: Enter your own cents-per-point (cpp) (e.g., 1.7 for Hyatt, 1.3 for Alaska) to see the true "Net Monthly Value" of your setup after card fees and credits.

🛠 How to Use the Lab

1. Configuration

Card Tier: Select Blue, Obsidian, or Palladium. The tool automatically accounts for the 2x Palladium floor or the 3x Obsidian category bonuses.

Point Valuation: Set your target redemption value. This shifts the "Efficiency Intelligence" and the profitability metrics.

Mortgage Config: Click "Edit Amounts" to enter your exact mortgage or rent payments and give them custom labels.

2. The "22nd of the Month" Check

This tool is most powerful in the final week of your billing cycle:

Enter your Settled Monthly Spend (total amount already posted to your Bilt card).

Click "Auto-Optimize".

The tool will tell you which mortgage payments to process through Bilt to ensure you don't fall into "Tier 0" (the 250-point trap) or to help you "leap" into a higher multiplier tier by reducing the routed principal.

3. Efficiency Benchmarking

Watch the Marginal Yield Chart.

If a bar is Purple, spending on Bilt to reach that tier beats a standard 5% cashback card.

If a bar is Grey, you are better off hitting your 25% Bilt floor and then putting all subsequent spending on your 5% rival card.
